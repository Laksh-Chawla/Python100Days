# Python100Days
This repository contains my personal solutions and projects developed during [Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). The primary purpose is to document my learning journey and track my progress.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a personal log of my development in Python programming. It is not intended as a course promotion or a comprehensive guide but as a reflection of my learning process.

## Acknowledgements
Credit to Angela Yu for designing the course and providing the foundational materials upon which these projects are built.
